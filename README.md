# Altiq-Hospitality-Insights
I am delighted to present my findings from the "Hospitality Analysis Project," part of the Code Basics Resume Project Challenge. 🚀

🎯 Problem Statement:
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.
